Strategy backtest for identifying intraday buying opportunities based on gap-down and intraday dip patterns using NIFTYBEES data.
# Intraday Gap-Down Buy Strategy on NIFTYBEES

This project analyzes and backtests an intraday trading strategy using historical NIFTYBEES data. The strategy identifies two types of buying opportunities:

1. Gap-Down Buy at Open: If the market opens 1% lower than the previous dayâ€™s close, a buy signal is generated at the opening price.
2. Intraday Dip Buy at Close: If the market closes 1% below its opening price, a second buy signal is generated at the closing price.

If both conditions occur on the same day, two buys are recorded.
